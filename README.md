Mothcam is repository with the scripts and config files meant for turning the [LedEmmer](https://www.vlinderstichting.nl/wat-wij-doen/meetnetten/meetnet-nachtvlinders/ledemmers/) into a Mothcam camera trap for monitoring moth assemblages. The repositories are written with Python and make use of the [Picamera2 repository](https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2/tree/main). This repository has been tested with a Raspberry Pi4 and a Raspberry Pi Zero W.

## installation Guide
The Mothcam is programmed with the Raspberry pi OS Lite (32/64 bit) Debian Bookworm. Therefore, it is recommended to use the same OS. 

Before downloading the OS onto the micro-SD card make the SSH is turned on and the Pi has the access to the internet by filling in the field for Wi-Fi network name and password. It's also imporant to remember the Hostname and password which can be set before installing the OS. After installing the OS, the micro-SD can by put into the Pi and the Pi can now be used.

Once the has started up for the first time the following command need to ran:
  ```sudo apt update```
